Brian built his own car and was confused about what name he should keep for it. He asked Roman for help. Roman being his good friend, suggested a lot of names. 
Brian only liked names that:
- Consisted of exactly three distinct characters, say C1, C2 and C3
- Satisfied the criteria that the string was of the form - C1^n C2^n C3^n : This means, first C1 occurs n times, then C2 occurs n times and then C3 occurs n times. 
For example, xyz, ccaarr, mmmiiiaaa satisfy the criteria, but xyzw, aabbbcccc don't. 
Given N names suggested by Roman, print "OK" if Brian likes the name and "Not OK" if he doesn't.

Write a method to return the same backed with unit tests.

Input:
One string s

Output:
return "OK" if the name satisfies the criteria, else return "Not OK".

example : - i/p - bbbrrriii o/p - OK
	    i/p - brian o/p - Not OK
Note - Lowercase or upecase letters are considered same.
