Alfi asked Roy to go for shopping with her. 
Witty Roy came up with a condition. He said, for each product of MRP (Maximum Retail Price) R, she'll have to pay minimum of all the prime factors of R and he himself will pay rest of the amount. 
Without giving it a second thought Alfi agreed.

Now they bought N number of products. You're to find how much money did Roy had to pay for each product.

The method should be backed with unit tests.

Input - An array/list of MRPs of the products.
Output - Integer amount Roy has to pay.

Example - i/p - 5,10 o/p - 8

Note - Ignore fractional part of MRP
