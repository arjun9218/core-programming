Every day, Mike goes to his job by a bus, where he buys a ticket. On the ticket, there is a letter-code that can be represented as a string of upper-case Latin letters.
Mike believes that the day will be successful in case two or more different letters in the code alternate. Otherwise, he believes that the day will be unlucky. 
You are given a ticket code. Please determine, whether the day will be successful for Mike or not. 
Return "YES" or "NO" (without quotes) corresponding to the situation.

The input to the method should contain a single string S denoting the letter code on the ticket.
The method should be backed with unit tests
For each test case, output a single line containing "YES" (without quotes) in case the day will be successful and "NO" otherwise.
Example – i/p = ABABAB o/p = YES  i/p = ABCABC o/p = YES  i/p = ABCXABC o/p = NO
