You are converting an old code for a new version of the compiler.

In the old code we have used "->" for pointers. 
But now we have to replace each "->" with a ".". But this replacement shouldn't be done inside commments. 
A comment is a string that starts with "//".

Write a method for the same backed with unit tests.

input - An array/list of strings.
ouput - An array/list of Strings.

Example - i/p - int t; //variable t, t->a=0;  //t->a does something, return 0;
	  o/p - int t; //variable t, t->a=0;  //t->a does something, return 0;
