John has discovered various rocks. 
Each rock is composed of various elements, and each element is represented by a lower-case Latin letter from 'a' to 'z'. 
An element can be present multiple times in a rock. An element is called a gem-element if it occurs at least once in each of the rocks.

Given the list of  rocks with their compositions, find the number of gem-elements that exist in those rocks.

The method should be backed with unit tests

i/p - An array/list of strings.
o/p - An integer ( number of gem-elements)

Example - i/p - abcdde,baccd,eeabg o/p - 2
